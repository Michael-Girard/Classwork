Radix Sort

Creates NUMBER_OF_INTEGERS integers with INTEGER_DIGIT_LENGTH length, then sorts then into 9 arraylists in ascending order based on its first digit.

For example, for integers of digit length 4 (up to 9999), the first arraylist will store integers between 0 and 999, the second between 1000 and 1999, and so on.
